# Outlier detection using Z-score in python
This repository contains Python code for detecting outliers in datasets using Z-score, a statistical method commonly employed for identifying data points that deviate significantly from the mean.


**Overview**

Outliers, or anomalies, can skew statistical analyses and machine learning models, leading to inaccurate results. Detecting and appropriately handling outliers are essential steps in data preprocessing. This repository provides a straightforward implementation of outlier detection using Z-score, which measures how many standard deviations a data point is from the mean.

**Key Features**

**Z-score Calculation:** The code calculates the Z-score for each data point in a given dataset, enabling the identification of outliers based on user-defined thresholds.

**Data Cleaning:** Before calculating Z-scores, the code includes a function to clean and convert string-type columns to float type, ensuring accurate calculations.

**Visualization:** The code includes visualization techniques such as histograms and boxplots to visualize the distribution of the data and identify potential outliers visually.


**Usage**

The provided code example demonstrates outlier detection using Z-score analysis for the 'ipa_funding' column and 'ma_premium' in the dataset. Additionally, outlier analysis for another column ('another_column' for example) is presented in detail. For the remaining columns, a generalized approach using a list is described.

**Detailed Analysis for 'ipa_funding' and 'ma_premium'**

The provided code analyzes outliers in the 'ipa_funding' column and 'ma_premium' in detail:

**Clean Data:** The 'ipa_funding' column is cleaned and converted to float type to ensure accurate calculations.

**Visualize Distribution:** The distribution of 'ipa_funding' is visualized using a histogram and a boxplot to understand its distribution and identify potential outliers visually.

**Calculate Z-scores:** Z-scores are computed for the 'ipa_funding' column using the mean and standard deviation of the column's values.

**Identify Outliers:**  Outliers are identified based on a predefined threshold (e.g., 3 standard deviations from the mean) using Z-scores.

**Generalized Approach for Remaining Columns**

For the remaining columns in the dataset, you can use a generalized approach by specifying a list of columns and analyzing them iteratively:

**# List of columns for outlier analysis**
columns_of_interest = ['column1', 'column2', 'column3']  # Add additional columns as needed

**# Perform Z-score analysis for each column in the list**
for column_name in columns_of_interest:
    # Check if the column contains numeric data
    if df[column_name].dtype != 'float64':
        # Clean and convert the column to float type
        df = clean_and_convert_to_float(df, column_name)
    
    # Compute mean and standard deviation
    column_mean = np.nanmean(df[column_name].values.tolist())
    column_std = np.nanstd(df[column_name].values.tolist())
    
    # Calculate Z-scores
    df['zscore_' + column_name] = (df[column_name] - column_mean) / column_std
    
    # Count outliers
    outliers_count = len(df[df['zscore_' + column_name].abs() > threshold])
    
    # Print the count of outliers for each column
    print("Number of outliers in", column_name, ":", outliers_count)
