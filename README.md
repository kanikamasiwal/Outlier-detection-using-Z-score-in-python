# Outlier-detection-using-Z-score-in-python
This repository contains Python code for detecting outliers in datasets using Z-score, a statistical method commonly employed for identifying data points that deviate significantly from the mean.


**Overview**

Outliers, or anomalies, can skew statistical analyses and machine learning models, leading to inaccurate results. Detecting and appropriately handling outliers are essential steps in data preprocessing. This repository provides a straightforward implementation of outlier detection using Z-score, which measures how many standard deviations a data point is from the mean.

**Key Features**

**Z-score Calculation:** The code calculates the Z-score for each data point in a given dataset, enabling the identification of outliers based on user-defined thresholds.

**Data Cleaning:** Before calculating Z-scores, the code includes a function to clean and convert string-type columns to float type, ensuring accurate calculations.

**Visualization:** The code includes visualization techniques such as histograms and boxplots to visualize the distribution of the data and identify potential outliers visually.


**Usage**

The provided code can be used as follows:

**Read Data:** Read your dataset in the form of a CSV file using Pandas DataFrame.

**Data Cleaning:** Clean and convert any necessary columns from string type to float type using the clean_and_convert_to_float function.

**Visualization:** Visualize the distribution of the data using histograms and boxplots to identify potential outliers.

**Compute Z-scores:** Calculate Z-scores for the desired columns in your dataset.

**Identify Outliers:** Identify outliers based on Z-score thresholds and analyze the results.
