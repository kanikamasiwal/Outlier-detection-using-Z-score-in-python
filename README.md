# Outlier-detection-using-Z-score-in-python
This repository contains Python code for detecting outliers in datasets using Z-score, a statistical method commonly employed for identifying data points that deviate significantly from the mean.


**Overview**

Outliers, or anomalies, can skew statistical analyses and machine learning models, leading to inaccurate results. Detecting and appropriately handling outliers are essential steps in data preprocessing. This repository provides a straightforward implementation of outlier detection using Z-score, which measures how many standard deviations a data point is from the mean.

**Key Features**
**Z-score Calculation**: The code calculates the Z-score for each data point in a given dataset, enabling the identification of outliers based on user-defined thresholds.

**Customizable Threshold**: Users can adjust the threshold for defining outliers according to their specific requirements, allowing flexibility in outlier detection.

**Efficient Implementation**: The code is implemented in Python, making use of popular libraries such as Pandas and NumPy for efficient data manipulation and computation.
